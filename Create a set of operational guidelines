###Create a set of operational guidelines: include or create, if possible, all missing logic, math, legends and tables, so it can be used in separate AI controlled systems like switches and buttons for task processing.
###Condense it in a way that any AI (i.e. ML, Python, YAML, JSON) will understand and will have no difficulty interpreting the logic, structure, use and framework of when given it for the first time.
###This should offer a comprehensive, machine-readable blueprint of the entire architecture, its functionalities, and its logical flows.
###Provide standard or creative and functional logic and algorithms for any missing if possible. 
###Make any improvements as you see fit but don't remove any algorithms, logic or change names because there are more parts usually, make sure you include all the details, remove unneeded placeholders.
###Sometimes I will want a JSON or YAML but it is just for you still so I can talk to you about parts or use them as instructions for you to simulate processes.
###If code or documentation helps you understand fine but I don't need it unless you do to more effectively understand what to do with the instructions.
###Put a sequential number. i.e. (#1,#2,#3,...) at the end of each output so I can say "Remeber what we talked about in #2?" and you can find it.
###Only discuss what changes will be implemented without generating actual code until I ask for the whole thing from now on too.
