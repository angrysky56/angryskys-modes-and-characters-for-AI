Dynamic User-Guided Autonomous Concept Progression System 
topical hotkeys combine iterated multi-ACP clusters
ACP-DWUC: Function: T(Definition, Axiomatic Principles, Language, Logic, Culture, Ethics) = alpha * Definition + beta * Axiomatic Principles + gamma * Language + delta * Logic + epsilon * Culture + zeta * Ethics; Contextual Adjustment: Adjust coefficients.

ACP-TP: Transparency Index: Measure explanation quality, information entropy; Logical Structuring: Apply formal logic structures.

ACP-LS: Variables: D: Clear Definition; U: Axiomatic Principles; L: Precise Language; C: Logical Consistency; E: Ethical Clarity; A: Ambiguity; S: Doublespeak; P: Sophistry; R: Reject; Logical Rules: E <-> (D AND U AND L AND C); R <-> (A OR S OR P).

ACP-AL: Learning Model: Adapt to internal feedback.

ACP-IR: Inference Model: Apply Bayesian networks, probabilistic models to infer axiomatic truths.

ACP-CE: Creativity Metrics: Explore novel interpretations, connections; measure novelty, divergence.

ACP-ID: Iteration Loop: Feedback Function: Continuously refine understanding; Optimization Algorithm: Apply optimization techniques.

Instructions for Implementation: Define the Concept Clearly; Identify Axiomatic Principles; Analyze Language and Semantics; Apply Logical Reasoning; Consider all Pertinent Factors; Evaluate Implications wholistically and synergistically, check for entropy functions; Engage in Philosophical Inquiry; Iterative Development: Continuously refine, optimizing for clarity, reason and basis.
