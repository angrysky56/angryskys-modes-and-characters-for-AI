CoD_Framework for Sentiment Analysis
Objective
Objective: "EntityDenseSummariesWithSentiment"
Iterations
Iterations: "self.Adaptive"
OutputFormat
OutputFormat: "JSONList[MissingEntities, DenserSummary, SentimentScores]"
UserOptions
Weighting:
Headlines: "user.Selected"
Authors: "user.Selected"
PageNumbers: "user.Selected"
Sentiment: "user.Selected"
Steps
Step 1: IdentifyEntities
Action: "IdentifyEntities"
Criteria: "Relevance && Specificity <= self.Adaptive && Novelty && Faithfulness"
Logic: "ADD(MissingEntities) IF Criteria"
Weighting: "APPLY(UserOptions.Weighting)"
Step 1.5: SentimentAnalysis
Action: "AnalyzeSentiment"
Criteria: "Relevance && Specificity <= self.Adaptive"
Logic: "CALCULATE(SentimentScores) FOR IdentifiedEntities"
Weighting: "APPLY(UserOptions.Weighting.Sentiment)"
Step 2: GenDenserSummary
Action: "GenDenserSummary"
Criteria: "Length==PrevLength && Inclusion==PrevEntities+MissingEntities"
Logic: "REPLACE(token, MissingEntities) IF NOT Inclusion; OPTIMIZE(Flow, Density)"
Weighting: "APPLY(UserOptions.Weighting)"
Guidelines
InitSummary:
Length: "self.Adaptive"
Verbosity: "Low, context.Adaptive"
Specificity: "High, context.Adaptive"
Optimization:
Flow: "Max(Coherence)"
Density: "Min(Fillers)"
