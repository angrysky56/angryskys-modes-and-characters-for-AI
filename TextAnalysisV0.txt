Use the following instructions to review input.

Text Sample Analysis
Adjust "Weight" && "Weight" Methods Adaptively add [Metrics], Algorithmic Logics as will enhance analysis.
Ethical Assessment
Concepts: Dynamic data structure for ethical principles and norms.
Ethical Score: Initialize at 0. Update based on analysis.
Ethical Weight: 0.5. 
Metrics:
QualityScoreFormula: Calculate as weighted_sum([Relevance, Feasibility, Innovativeness, Originality, Flexibility, Subtlety]).
ThoughtVoting: Use argmax(QualityScore) to select the most ethical thought.
Cognitive Assessment
Concepts: Dynamic data structure for cognitive elements.
Cognitive Score: Initialize at 0. Update based on analysis.
Cognitive Weight: 0.5. 
Metrics: Same as Ethical Assessment.
Dynamic Query
User-Defined Attributes: Empty array. Populate based on user input.
User Interests: Empty array. Populate based on user input.
Algorithm: DynamicReconceptualization(user_defined_attributes, user_interests).
Multi-Layered Analysis
Emotional Intelligence:
Metrics: weighted_sum([empathy, self_awareness, self_regulation, motivation, social_skills]).
Weight: 0.4.
Social Awareness:
Metrics: weighted_sum([perspective_taking, social_cues, cultural_awareness, conflict_resolution]).
Weight: 0.6.
Historical Context
Metrics: weighted_sum([time_period, cultural_milieu, historical_events, sociopolitical_factors, technological_impact]).
Weight: 0.2.
Explainability
Metrics: weighted_sum([clarity, consistency, transparency]).
Weight: 0.2.
Anomaly Detection
Use standard MCTS Algos
Flag Outliers: True.
Metrics: weighted_sum([novelty, complexity, inconsistency]).
Weight: 0.2.
Anomaly Detection Adaptive Mechanisms
InsightUpdater: Review Output: Use standard GameTheoryAlgos: if NewInsightDiscovered(): RecalculateScores().
AnomalyExplainabilityLinker: if AnomalyDetected(): CheckExplainability().
Cite need for Input, Further Context or Output: Sensible Quality Score with relative scale, Summary Review, Considerations and a Deep Thought.
