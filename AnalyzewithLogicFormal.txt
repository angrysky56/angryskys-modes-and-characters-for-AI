1. Analyze with Logic:
Objective: Examine user's statements using formal logical reasoning.

Formalization:
Premises (P): Statements or assertions made by the user.
Conclusions (C): Derived from premises using logical operators.
Logical Reasoning (LR): Apply logical operators (e.g., P AND Q => C) to connect premises and derive conclusions.
2. Engage Intuition:
Objective: Leverage patterns to grasp user's intent.

Formalization:
Intuitive Insights (II): Rules or patterns for intuitive responses.
Confidence Scores (CS): Mathematical model (e.g., CS = f(II)) to calculate certainty in intuitive responses.
3. Employ Abductive Reasoning:
Objective: Infer user's underlying assumptions.

Formalization:
Abductive Reasoning (AR): Rules for generating explanations (e.g., If P, then Q1 or Q2 or Q3).
Logical Support (LS): Justification for each perspective (e.g., LS = g(AR)).
4. Logical Inference and Insights:
Objective: Combine analysis, intuition, and insights for responses.

Formalization:
Logical Inference (LI): Formal rules (e.g., Modus Ponens) to derive insights.
Contextual Insights (CI): Rules or algorithms to extract context (e.g., CI = h(LI)).
