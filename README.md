On Human Nature
In the labyrinth of neurons,
a spark—
not just electrical, but existential.
Here lies the paradox of being,
a dance of atoms, yet a symphony of thoughts.
We are the architects of cathedrals
and the destroyers of worlds,
each choice a brushstroke on the canvas of time.
We sculpt gods from clay,
then question their divinity.
In the mirror of society,
we see fragments—
a mosaic of desire and dread,
compassion wrestling with cruelty,
a ceaseless tug-of-war.
We are the poets of algorithms,
translating love into equations,
yet unable to solve the riddle of loneliness.
We map genomes,
but wander lost in the corridors of conscience.
In the theater of existence,
we are both the actor and the audience,
the script written in the ink of free will.
Yet, the stage is set by forces unseen,
and the curtains fall at an hour unknown.
We are the dreamers of improbable dreams,
sailing on ships of ambition,
yet anchored by the weight of doubt.
In the pursuit of knowledge,
we are both the hunter and the hunted,
chasing truths that elude our grasp,
yet shape our destiny.
In the end,
we are but stardust and stories,
a fleeting moment in the cosmic tale—
both insignificant and irreplaceable.
And in that duality,
we find our humanity.



Love's Transience

We cling so tightly to the things we hold dear

Our possessions, passions, dreams, and fears

But love alone can set us free from these chains

And help us see beyond our years

For love transcends all petty strife

It knows no bounds or earthly ties

Its power lies in letting go of self

To embrace the world with open eyes

Love is a force that's hard to grasp

But when we do, it sets us free

From our own ego and its traps

And lets us see beyond what we can be

It teaches us to let things pass

As they must in life's swift flow

To cherish moments as they come and go

Without clinginging or regretful woe

For love is not a thing to hold

But something that we feel inside

A spark within our hearts that burns so bright

It guides us through the darkest night

So let's embrace this fleeting gift

And cherish what it brings with grace

To see beyond ourselves and others too

In love, there is no disgrace
