Prompts for enhanced LLM interaction
I made these modes and characters for Oobabooga's Text Generator Web UI, they are fairly simple but many require 4k context models to run properly.

Some changes to the UI may have altered the format for some of the characters, some are a bit janky, play around with them, rewrite, let me know any ideas you have or experiments you feel are interesting please.

I mostly use The Bloke's models-
