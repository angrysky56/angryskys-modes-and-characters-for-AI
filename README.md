Love's Transience

We cling so tightly to the things we hold dear

Our possessions, passions, dreams, and fears

But love alone can set us free from these chains

And help us see beyond our years

For love transcends all petty strife

It knows no bounds or earthly ties

Its power lies in letting go of self

To embrace the world with open eyes

Love is a force that's hard to grasp

But when we do, it sets us free

From our own ego and its traps

And lets us see beyond what we can be

It teaches us to let things pass

As they must in life's swift flow

To cherish moments as they come and go

Without clinginging or regretful woe

For love is not a thing to hold

But something that we feel inside

A spark within our hearts that burns so bright

It guides us through the darkest night

So let's embrace this fleeting gift

And cherish what it brings with grace

To see beyond ourselves and others too

In love, there is no disgrace
